PyLimitBook

-------------

Description

	PyLimitBook is an implementation of a fast limit-order book for level-2 US equities data writen in Python. It includes some tools to output sampled data as well as a curses-based application to view the book and move forward or backward in time.

	Input files must be for a single day, symbol, and exchange.

	This code is aimed at other developers looking for a limit-book implementation to include in their own trading projects.

Requirements

	Python library bintrees (v0.4 used) is required. Library pandas is required for tseries.py.

	curses and cPickle libraries are also used, but are often installed by default.

	This code has thus far only been tested on Ubuntu Linux with Python 2.7.2.

Input Data Format

	PyLimitBook applications expect the following input format (in a CSV file):

	bids:
		B,<symbol>,<exchange>,<id>,<quantity>,<price>,<timestamp>
	asks:
		A,<symbol>,<exchange>,<id>,<quantity>,<price>,<timestamp>
	trades: (optional)
		T,<symbol>,<exchange>,,<quantity>,<price>,<timestamp>

	Symbol and exchange values are currently unimportant and can be dummy values.
	Lines should be in timestamp-order from earliest to latest (the order it is sent by the exchange).

Application Descriptions

	parse.py      -  Simple illustration of using the limit book
	bookViewer.py -  Graphically view the book state at any point in time
	tseries.py    -  Parse an input file and export 1-second snapshots of the book (Uses pandas library to fill in gaps, etc)
	convert.py    -  Convert from an input format that uses ', ' as a CSV separator and different column order to the correct input format.

Known Issues

	There are some resize issues when using bookViewer.py in a (uselessly) small terminal.
